Generator Synchronization:

In dynamic synchronisation sequence, the synchronising genset is brought to a different frequency than the busbar frequency. This frequency difference is called "slip frequency". Typically, the synchronising genset is running with a positive slip frequency. This means that the genset is running with a higher speed than other generators already connected to the busbar. The objective is to avoid a reverse power trip at the instant of synchronisation.

Animation below shows a synchroscope with following parameters:
- Bus frequency = 50 Hz
- Generator frequency = 50.1 Hz
- Frequency Slip = 50.1 - 50 = 0.1 Hz

tsync = 1 / (f1 - f2) = 1 / (50.1 - 50) = 10 s 

In this case, the two systems will be in synchronism every 10 seconds. The synchroscope will also achieve one full rotation in 10 seconds. 

If slip frequency is 0.2 Hz, the full rotation of synchroscope takes 5 seconds, and so on.<img width="644" height="341" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16fc9c47-6a35-4f29-a770-9da5b27e66cf" />
